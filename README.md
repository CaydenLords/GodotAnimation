# Overview

I've always wanted to learn how to use a game engine, and Godot is free to use! So I started using it, thinking that it would be an easy learn! _how foolish._

This is my second Godot project, where I devoted myself to learning animation and collision. Once again, it was suprisingly harder than I thought. However, I learned _two_ different ways to animate as well as how collision works for different nodes.

# Development Environment

Obviously this uses Godot, and that's about it! It uses the native programming language GDScript.

# Useful Websites

Use the main website for Godot! It has a lot of guides on it.

- [Godot Manual](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/best_practices/index.html)

# Future Work
What's next in my journey through Godot? Well, there's a lot of nodes and different working parts that I'd like to learn about. There's an entire physics engine just sitting in there, sounds, and a 3D system as well!
